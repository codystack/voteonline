                  All users agree to work actively with the other parties to your transactions to resolve any disputes that

                  proof deemed necessary to determine the validity of the transaction. If any charge-back claim occurs 
                  (as the result of a dispute or for any reason whatsoever), Organizers must acknowledge that Vote Online does 
                  not control the outcome of the charge-back decision reached by the issuing bank; accept the decision of the 
                  issuing bank as final and legally binding; and recognize that payment may not be received if the issuing bank rules against the Organizer in relation to the payment received.
