                    Any information that is collected is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is collected. 
                    We may, however, modify and revise our privacy policy from time-to-time. If we make any material changes to this policy, 
                    we will notify you of such changes by posting them on Vote Online or by sending you an email or other notification, 
                    and we will indicate when such changes will become effective. By continuing to access or use Vote Online after those
